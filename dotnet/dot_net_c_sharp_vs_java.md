# C# for Java Developers
There are other blogs and articles out there with this same or very similar name, this is simply my take and personal
notes on the topic. I am writing this as I re-learn Viual Studio and C# as I have only used it for 4 months at an
internship in college more than 5 years ago. Since then I have been mostly an enterprise Java developer, with a helping
of devops tools and python here and there.

## Section 1
Talk about stuff.

use `code` examples:
```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
```

## Section 2
And another...
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

## Code Samples w/ gitbooks-theme-api

This fancy theme lets you specify examples in multiple languages

{% sample lang="js" %}
```bash
$ npm install gitbook-api
```

{% sample lang="go" %}
```bash
$ go get github.com/GitbookIO/go-gitbook-api
```

{% common %}
This will appear for both JavaScript and Go.
{% endmethod %}
